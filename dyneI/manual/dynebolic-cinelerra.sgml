  A long time ago there was a heroine who didn't belong but through the power of        
   a magic slipper briefly joined the ranks of the accepted majority. Cinelerra          
   was opposed by almost every Linux user at the time of its inception. Windows is       
   a general purpose computing platform. Users are supposed to install their own         
   software on it and use it for more than one complicated task. Linux is not a          
   general purpose computing platform. Linux is far more suited for a single, very       
   simple task and preconfiguration in dedicated hardware.

   Cinelerra, however, is designed to run on Linux and in a general purpose,             
   windowed environment with other programs. For most users this is heresy but a         
   small number of users may still find Cinelerra useful.
