1.    Why use LOADLIN ?
      =================

      LOADLIN is the safest way to boot Linux from your hard disk,
      if you have a bootable DOS-partition besides Linux on your machine.

      Most Linux-newbees are too impatient to read the very good (but also
      long) documentation of LILO (the standard Linux loader), and start
      using it incorrectly, resulting in an unbootable DOS after this
      (the MBR gots overwritten, 'fdisk /MBR' not always repairs).
      For those impatient ones LOADLIN is the best loader to start with.

      LOADLIN needs not to be installed in any way, it is usable as is
      and the kernel images can reside on any DOS accessable medium
      (even on a network drive). This also makes LOADLIN an exellent
      tool, if it comes to boot your Linux after a crash and a
      filesystem restore from backup medium (you must run LILO after
      this, but you can't if you have not yet booted, isn't it?).

      Many CDrom producers already have seen the advantage of starting
      the Linux-installation process by means of LOADLIN, because it
      runs out of the box. And using DOS to push Linux on the road
      isn't wrong, if you have DOS (or Windows 95 DOS mode) available.
      With LOADLIN you can directly boot Linux from the CD without
      needing an intermediate bootfloppy.

                         --------- +++  --------


2.    Features of LOADLIN
      ===================

      LOADLIN is highly adaptable to different DOS configurations, and now
      has very few loading restrictions. It makes use of extended memory and
      also can load big kernels (bzImages) and ramdisk images (initrd)
      directly high. The bzImage+initrd standard was jointly developed
      by the LILO-author (Werner Almesberger) and the LOADLIN-author (me)
      and is part of the official kernel since version 1.3.73.

      It is also capable of booting a UMSDOS-based system from a DOS drive.

      Some options (-v, -t, -d) produce debug information, so if you have
      problems, you can follow what is really being done by LOADLIN.

      LOADLIN also can load out of Virtual-86 mode (which is normal when
      using EMS drivers) if a VCPI server is present.



                         --------- +++  --------



3.    How to use LOADLIN
      ==================

      NOTE:

      LOADLIN is a utility which starts a "logical reload" of your machine,
      causing DOS to be completely overlaid with Linux.  When you wish to
      return to DOS you must use the Linux "reboot" command.


3.1.  What you need
      -------------

      1. A 386 or higher CPU (of course!),
         DOS or WINDOWS95 installed on your machine.

      2. Any compressed linux kernel image  (zImage, bzImage).
         NOTE: zImage is the old kernel binary format, bzImage is the
         new one ( kernel version >= 1.3.73), which can have a commpressed
         size of 1Meg, hence taking kernels up to 2Meg uncompressed.
         In the following we will refer only to zImage, though you may
         put a bzImage in place of it.

      3. The  LODLIN16.TGZ  package, which includes among other things:

          ( Note: these are DOSish files )
          LOADLIN.EXE
          DOC\MANUAL.TXT (this file)
          Example parameters file, DOC\TEST.PAR
          DOC\PARAMS.DOC


3.2.  Booting from the DOS prompt
      ---------------------------

3.2.1 Quick start
      -----------

      For the rest of this documentation I will assume that you have
      unpacked  LODLIN16.TGZ  into the directory  C:\LOADLIN.

      At the DOS prompt you can type, for example:

         C:> CD \LOADLIN
         C:\LOADLIN> LOADLIN zimage /dev/hdb1 ro vga=ask

      or, if you want to load a big kernel together with a RAM disk:

         C:\LOADLIN> LOADLIN bzimage /dev/ram rw initrd=diskimage

      or, if you have more parameters than will fit into the 128-byte
      DOS command line:

         C:\LOADLIN> LOADLIN @params

      An example params file is "test.par".    Please read it.

      A detailed collection (extracted from kernel sources) of most
      command line parameters can be found in the file  PARAMS.DOC
      ( however, it is a bit out of date now )
      A much better list of boot parameters can be found in Paul Gortmakers
      BootPrompt-HOWTO, which can be access by WWW:

          http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html
      or
          http://rsphy1.anu.edu/~gpg109/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html


3.2.2 Quick help
      ----------

      You can get online help and configuration analysis by typing:

         C:\LOADLIN> loadlin <enter>

      or, perhaps a bit more helpful:

         C:\LOADLIN> loadlin | more <enter>


      You then get an output like this (from my machine) ....

      NOTE: All LOADLIN options (such as -t,... ) MUST come before
            the Linux command_line params


3.2.3 Starting linux from a batch file (LINUX.BAT)
      --------------------------------------------

      Most DOS users have disk caching (e.g. SMARTDRV) activated.
      If "write-behind" caching is supported by the cache program,
      then any unwritten cache buffers MUST be flushed before
      LOADLIN is called.

      Example:

       C\LOADLIN> smartdrv /C    do this to "sync" your disk (usually not
                                  needed for DOS 6.2, but it doesn't hurt)
       C\LOADLIN> loadlin ....


      It would be much smarter to use a batch file something like this:

      +-------------------- start of LINUX.BAT
      |
      |  SMARTDRV /C
      |  C:\LOADLIN\LOADLIN C:\LOADLIN\ZIMAGE root=/dev/hdb2 ro vga=3
      |
      +-------------------- end of LINUX.BAT


      So you could simply type:

       C> linux

      ... and you are on the road!

      A sample LINUX.BAT file is provided with the LOADLIN package.



3.2.4 Loading Ramdisks with newer kernels
      -----------------------------------

      If you have a kernel image which is newer than version 1.3.72,
      LOADLIN can load the ramdisk directly from a file and let
      Linux mount the ramdisk (/dev/ram) as root filesystem.
      The file must contain the image of any Linux supported
      file system, such as minix or ext2. The technique used is
      called 'initrd' and is more flexible than the old loading
      from floppy. There can be the following cases:

      A) You simple want to load the ramdisk and have that mounted as
         root FS.

         C\LOADLIN> loadlin zimage root=/dev/ram rw initrd=imagefile

         You will see two LOADING.... sequences, one for the kernel
         and the other for the ramdisk.

      B) You want to have the ramdisk loaded and mounted only to
         bootstrap a bigger system. Your kernel has only support
         for few driver, but not all. Well, then the contents
         of your ramdisk image must contain an executable '/linuxrc'
         which is able to load kernel modules (via insmod). After
         /linuxrc has terminated, the root FS is remounted either
         to the device you supplied via root=/dev/..., or to the
         device that /linuxrc has chosen. This technique is described
         in detail in the file linux/Documentation/initrd.txt which is
         part of the kernel source. The LOADLIN call for
         loading such a configuration is:

         C\LOADLIN> loadlin zimage root=/dev/hda1 ro initrd=imagefile

      The non-initrd method, i.e. _not_ LOADLIN loads the ramdisk
      but the kernel does it from a floppy, has changed with Linux 1.3.48.
      It now look like this:

         C\LOADLIN> loadlin zimage root=/dev/fd0 rw load_ramdisk=1

      or, if you want have a prompt before inserting the floppy:

         C\LOADLIN> loadlin zimage root=/dev/fd0 rw load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1

      The size of the ramdisk is allocated dynamically.
      NOTE: In all cases the ramdisk image may be compressed (gziped)



3.2.5 Floppys and Ramdisks using older kernels ( Linux < 1.3.48 )
      -----------------------------------------------------------

      If LOADLIN encounters  ramdisk=xxxx  together with  root=/dev/fdx
      it loads the kernel image into memory, but before starting up
      Linux it prompts for insertion of the root floppy.

      This enables you to boot DOS (and start LOADLIN) from the same
      floppy drive as the root disk.

      Of course, this is a two-floppy boot, but with Linux becoming
      bigger and bigger there will be no room on the root floppy to
      hold both the kernel image and the root filesystem.  With
      LOADLIN there is no need for any fancy tricks to install a
      distribution when your drive configuration doesn't match that
      of the distribution.

      Examples:

        LST distribution comes only with a 3.5 inch floppy
        but your drive A: is 5.25 inch.

        Slackware 3.0 has a big directory tree with lots of possible
        drive constellations.  With LOADLIN you need only the image disk
        and an appropriate root disk.


3.2.6 System constraints
      ------------------

      With LOADLIN-1.6 there are _very_ few contraints left, given you
      use a newer kernel, because the kernel now supports LOADLIN and
      aids to overcome the restrictions of old LOADLIN-1.5.
      The * (asterix) marked parts below only apply, if your kernel
      is an old one (not supporting LOADLIN).

      *  There must be enough memory to load the compressed kernel image
         (between the start of LOADLIN and 090000h).

      -  If loading newer kernels, you must have enough konventional
         plus extended/XMS/VCPI memory to temporary hold the image
         (and eventually the ramdisk image)

      -  The field "load buffer size" of the LOADLIN verbose output
         tells you what you really have.

      *  The setup program and LOADLIN itself go into 090000h ... 09B000h,
         therefor you MUST have 640 K byte of base memory.

      -  Starting with Linux 1.1.43 the setup program does no longer
         fit into 2 K, so it is made of variable size and will grow
         over the time. Currently (1.3.91) setup is 9 * 512 bytes
         long and the setup buffer of LOADLIN has 31 * 512 bytes,
         so this will work for a long time.

      -  The field "setup buffer size" of the LOADLIN verbose output
         tells you what you really have.

      *  The remaining 12 Kbyte memory on top of the 640 K is
         hopefully enough for BIOS- and highloaded driver-data.


      -  DOS programs can be executed only in the so-called real mode
         (or on >386 in virtual-86 mode (V86)).

         Linux, however, runs in protected mode, and the kernel must be
         able to enter privilege level 0 (P0, supervisor mode).  However,
         from V86 it is impossible to switch to protected mode P0 if the
         V86 server does not allow this (as is the case with DPMI).

         Therefore:
         - You must be in 86 real mode (no EMS driver, no WINDOWS,
           no Windows 95 Graphics mode ...).
             or
         - You must have the VCPI server enabled in your EMS driver (still
           not running WINDOWS or Windows 95, however).
           Using EMM386 please avoid the NOVCPI-option, but NOEMS doesn't hurt.

         VCPI allows P0 and is supported by most EMS drivers, but never under
         MS-WINDOWS or Windows 95 (MICROSOFT doesn't like P0 for users).

      -  Physical-to-Virtual memory mapping must be identical for the first
         640K of RAM, which is a given under normal conditions but which
         also can be forced, typically by an EMS driver option like:

           EXCLUDE=1000-A000     (for 386MAX)
             or
           B=A000                (for EMM386.EXE, but normally not needed).


         Check the manual for your EMS driver for details.
         Don't worry, if something is missing LOADLIN will tell you.

         NOTE:

         May be that your VCPI server does garbage collection before
         entering protected mode, so please BE PATIENT, especially
         on systems with many mega bytes !

      -  Of course you must not execute LOADLIN out of Linux DOSEMU !
         If you do it, fortunately DOSEMU terminates because DOSEMU has
         no VCPI server, so your file systems remain intact.



3.3   Booting from CONFIG.SYS
      -----------------------

      Starting with DOS version 6.0 it is possible to boot different
      configurations during the startup of MSDOS. This is handled at the
      time of CONFIG.SYS interpretation.  Therefore this is often a good
      place to put the LOADLIN/Linux stuff.

      Even if you have decided to boot DOS, you can boot Linux later,
      either from the DOS command line or from a batch file.

3.3.2 Example of a CONFIG.SYS file (Windows 95)
      -----------------------------------------

      Having Windows 95 and Linux together on your machine, requires that
      you switch off some option in the hidden C:\MSDOS.SYS file.
      (which is a text file in Windows 95).
      NOTE:   DO NOT TRY TO START LOADLIN FROM WITHIN THE GUI !
      Change attribs of C:\MSDOS.SYS, so that it becomes visible and edit it:

      C:\MSDOS.SYS --------------------------------------
      BootGUI=0
      Logo=0
      ...
      ---------------------------------------------------

      This will avoid booting directly into the GUI and will you get a
      normal DOS prompt when chosing menuitem W95.
      ( To enter the GUI you only have to type:     C:>win    )
      Logo=0 switches the (graphics) logo off.
      There have been reports, that together with some graphic cards,
      Linux may come up with a 'blind' screen, if the Logo is displayed
      prior to booting.

      C:\CONFIG.SYS -------------------------------------
      [menu]
      menuitem=W95, Boot W95 DOS
      menuitem=LINUX, Boot Linux
      menudefault=W95,10

      [W95]
      rem all what you need for DOS
      ...

      [LINUX]
      shell=c:\loadlin\loadlin.exe @C:\loadlin\linuxpar.1

      [COMMON]
      rem THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING for COMMON
      rem move all you have to W95 part
      ---------------------------------------------------



3.3.3 Constraints in CONFIG.SYS syntax
      --------------------------------

      1. All parameters on the "shell=" lines are converted to uppercase
         by DOS, but Linux parameters are case sensitive. LOADLIN converts
         the following parameters back to lowercase:

           root=...
           ro
           rw
           mem=...
           no387
           single
           auto
           debug
           no-hlt
           reserve=...
           hd=...
           xd=...
           bmouse=...
           max_scsi_luns=

         Also, when using 'shell=loadlin.exe @params more_params'
         out of CONFIG.SYS, all of 'more_params' will be converted to lowercase.

         The following parameters are not put onto the commandline, but
         converted to numeric values for the boot sector:

           vga=...
           ramdisk=


      2. You can bypass the uppercase/lowercase problem by using a parameter
         file.   An example  CONFIG.SYS  line would be:

         [LINUX]
         shell=c:\loadlin\loadlin.exe @c:\loadlin\params

         You may ovewrite params which are _in_ the file by
         those coming behind the @..., such as

         [LINUX]
         shell=c:\loadlin\loadlin.exe @c:\loadlin\params root=/dev/other

         An example parameter file is "test.par".  Please read it.


                         --------- +++  --------




4.    The LOADLIN command line parameters
      ===================================

      Note that if you use a parameters file (for example  @TEST.PAR),
      this must be the FIRST parameter you use on the LOADLIN command
      line.  Other parameters, including the name of the zImage file,
      are contained within the parameters file.

      All parameter behind the @.. will be inserted after the
      parameters file has been read, and equal keywords are replaced.
      The first name within the parameters file _must_ be the
      kernel image file, if you want to overwrite it, you have to
      use the keyword 'image=' such as:

         C:> loadlin @test.par image=otherfile

      When Linux boots it gets a runstring passed from setup
      (the program that checks the basic hardware configuration
      and puts the machine into protected mode ). This string, the
      command line, is then checked for some well known compiled-in
      keywords.  Some are used to change kernel variables (such as
      mem=, root=, ro, rw, no387), some are passed to the device
      drivers (such as ether=, hd=, sound=) and some (such as single
      and auto) are passed as options to /etc/init (or /bin/init or
      /sbin/init, whatever is found first).

      See the file "PARAMS.DOC" for details.

      Any unknown keywords of format "keyword=value" are placed in
      "envp_init", which is also passed to /linuxrc (if you have initrd=)
      and to /etc/init.  This environment string can be checked in /etc/rc*
      (/etc/rc.d/rc.*). The whole commandline also is available
      via /proc/cmdline.


4.1   Maximum length of the command line
      ----------------------------------

      The length of a DOS command line can be 127 bytes (including
      the program name).  With a params file (@param)
      the length of the string passed to the kernel can in theory be
      2047 bytes, but the string is held in a temporary place and must
      be copied by the kernel to a save static buffer in init/main.
      This forces the maximum length to a compiled-in constant, which
      currently is 256 bytes.
      If you need a greater size, you can simply change COMMAND_LINE_SIZE
      in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c.




                         --------- +++  --------



5.    If you have problems
      ====================

      With the thousands of possible hardware/software configurations of a PC,
      a program can never be totally bug-free.
      So please, I need your feedback regarding problems you encounter.

      If you recognize a bug, please don't work around it, mail it to me !

      But, if you report a problem, I need information!  Something like
      "My screen always displays in blue, what is wrong?"  is not enough.

      LOADLIN can produce information for me (and for you) if you use
      the -d or -t switch.



5.1   Problems detecting V86
      ----------------------

      On some 486 clones we have problems with CR0 while probing for V86 mode.
      (as reported by Jacek Zapala zapala@if.pw.edu.pl ).
      It can happen that the CPU is in realmode, but PAGING is enabled !
      This is possible, but neither documented nor supported by INTEL.
      May be the motherboard's BIOS is mapping shadow ram this way,
      or one of those old and strange EMM managers is used,
      but probably this is an indication of a not exactly compatible
      486 clone. The -clone switch byepasses the CR0 check and assumes
      V86 if an EMM manger is found.
      But of course this EMM manager must not use real paging !

      On the other hand, if LOADLIN detects V86 _and_ you are sure that the
      machine is in _real_ realmode, then you may use the -f switch
      in order to force LOADLIN to 'detect' realmode.
      NOTE: This option intentionaly is not mentioned elsewere, because
      it realy is dangerous.


5.2.  Description of debug output (-v,-t,-d)
      --------------------------------------

      The ouput produced by the -v, -t or -d options occurs at the point at
      which the boot sector and setup are loaded and updated by LOADLIN.
      The information is that seen by Linux, but in the case of -t and -d,
      the zimage file is not loaded and linux is not started.

      Description:

7.    Contributions and Credits
      =========================

      Version-1.6 of LOADLIN ist part of a jointly developed new
      booting strategie (bzImage+initrd) for both LILO and LOADLIN,
      so I say many thanks to Werner Almesberger for cooperating with me.

      Thanks to Hubert Mantel from S.u.S.E GmbH, who compiled 'lots'
      of kernels with the bzImage+initr patches, and testet them havily
      on several  machines. Without him the patches never would have
      stabilized as quickly.
      He also was the first to realize a reasonable working /linuxrc.

      This program would be absolutely superfluous without Linus Torvalds,
      and thanks to him for putting our patches into the official kernel.

      This program could not have been written as quickly without the
      information found in the source code of F.Coutant's BOOTLIN.

      Jacques Gelinas encouraged me in realizing the VCPI-support.

      Alessandro Rubini contributed some code from his linuxEXE package
      and gave some important hints.

      Chuck Munro gave hints concerning problems with QEMM and ALPHA-
      tested version 1.4.
      He also did much work for better documentation.

      Javier Achirica invented the switch-out-of-setup method (LOADLIN-1.5).
      The trick is: let setup run in V86 and intercept just before
      going to protected mode.


      Important problem and bug reports came from:

      Mitchum Dsouza, UK
      Claus Tondering, Denmark
      Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer, Germany
      Jacek Zapala, Poland
      Jon Peatfield, UK
      Matthias Sattler, Germany
      Pim Zandenberg, Netherlands

      Thanks also to all the ALPHA testers, who responded on my
      "call for testers". The list is too long to put it here,
      but some of them did heavy testings:

      Michael Goddard, US
      Shih-Hua Chao, US
      Rene Baart, Netherlands
      Asad Khan,
      Jan Lien, Sweden


      Many thanks also to those people, who did not have any
      problems with LOADLIN, but nevertheless mailed me "it works"
      ( positive feedback is the best one ).


                         --------- END --------
