The kernel source in this directory has been downloaded from:

https://linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/freesh/

The config is within the tarball, the main difference from a devuan/debian/ubuntu kernel is that
debug info and signature have been disabled because it makes an enormous kernel and takes twice
as long to compile

scripts/config --disable DEBUG_INFO

We also override certificate checking
scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS
scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS

Once the config is copied in the source as .config it was compiled with

make bindeb-pkg

Because make deb-pkg require signatures.

Enjoy! \o/
