Nevertheless, an important step in setting up our digital photography workflow is updating the <code>lensfun</code> database. <code>lensfun</code> is an open, collaborative database of camera and lens profile, which are essential for RAW development operations, such as lens correction. If Darktable can't find the profile of your camera model or lens (or at least the closest possible one), chances are your <code>lensfun</code> database hasn't been updated.</p> <p>To do this, we open Konsole, and do the following:</p> <pre><code>&gt; lensfun-update-data\n</code></pre> <p>And that's it. You won't need to do anything else - Darktable or other RAW processing tools will use the updated <code>lensfun</code> database in the background.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#learn-more","title":"Learn more","text":"<ul> <li>The Darktable website, and its resources section</li> <li>The digiKam website</li> <li>The <code>lensfun</code> website, especially its FAQ</li> <li>dstyle.net, a huge collaborative collection of Darktable styles</li> <li>Pixls.us, one of the greatest resources for libre digital photography.
